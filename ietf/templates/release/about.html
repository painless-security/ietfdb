  <h1>About the IETF Datatracker</h1>
   <p>

      The IETF Datatracker is the primary day-to-day front-end to the IETF database for people
      who work on IETF standards.  It contains data about the documents, working groups,
      meetings, agendas, minutes, presentations, and more, of the IETF.

   </p>
   <p>

      The primary public face of the IETF is at <a href="https://www.ietf.org/">www.ietf.org</a>.

   </p>
   <p>

      All the Datatracker code is publicly avaliable from the
      <a href="https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/tools/ietfdb">IETF tools SVN repository</a>.
      Bug tickets and wiki notes are available from the 
      <a href="https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb">Issue Tracker</a>, and 
      there are also <a href="/release">release notes</a> available since version 2.00.

   </p>
   <p>

      Below you'll find a brief history of the datatracker development, in terms of the big
      moments.  For the nitty-gritty week-to-week code changes, please check the release
      notes or the commit log.

  <h2>Version 6.x Work</h2>
  <p>

     Between the release of 6.0.0 in April 2015 and the <a href="/release/">latest release</a>
     there has been numerous releases (75, as of 11 Feb 2017) which has extended the
     functionality of the datatracker substantially.  The <a href="/release/#release-list">release list</a>
     gives more information.

  </p>

  <h2>Version 6.0.0: Facelift using Bootstrap</h2>
  <p>

     During more than a year, from July 2013 to late 2014, <i>Lars Eggert</i> worked intensively
     on a major facelift to the datatracker, porting the GUI to Bootstrap.  The work
     took
     <a href="https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/log/personal/lars?rev=8652&amp;stop_rev=5871&amp;limit=500">
	287 separate commits
     </a>, and comprised changes to 1016 different files.

  </p>
  <p>

     This work has turned the IETF Datatracker website into a responsive website which
     support use on a much larger variety of devices, from small mobile devices to desktops.

  </p>
  <p>

     The work relies heavily on the capabilities of <a href="http://getbootstrap.com">
     Bootstrap</a>, and continues to use the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.org/">Django</a>
     framework which the datatracker has been build on since <a href="/release/2.00/">version
     2.00</a>.  It also uses icons from <a href="">FontAwesome</a>, and functions from
     <a href="https://django-bootstrap3.readthedocs.org/">django-bootstrap3</a>.

     (with the addition of complementing green and red colours for success and error indications),
     and a selection of fonts from
     <a href="http://www.paratype.com/public/">ParaType</a>
     (<a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?2G32">PT Serif</a> for body text,
     <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?2G2G">PT Sans Caption</a> for headers,
     <a href="http://www.identifont.com/show?2G2F">PT Sans</a> for menus,
     and PT Mono for monospaced documents).  (Even if PT Sans Caption was
     created as a 'Caption' (6-8pt) <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Font#Optical_size">
     optical size</a> font to go with PT Sans, it works well for headers when paired with PT Serif.)

  <h2>Version 5.x Work</h2>
  <p>

     Between the release of 5.0.0 in January 2014 and the last release in the 5.x series in
     April 2015, there were 42 releases containing bug fixes and features.  Worth mentioning
     were 4 code sprint releases, added support for the secretariat's agenda scheduling work,
     the addition of pages for <a href="/rg/">Research Groups</a> and <a
     href="/group/edu">Teams</a>, a <a href="/api/v1/?format=json">JSON interface</a> to the
     database for tool builders, improved <a href="/ipr/">IPR support</a>, a move to Django 1.7,
     and many <a href="https://trac.tools.ietf.org/tools/ietfdb/wiki/Testing?version=13">
     improvements in testing support</a>.

  <h2>Version 5.0.0: Shim Removal</h2>

  <h2>Version 4.00: New Database Schema</h2>

  <h2>Version 3.00: Django Port of the IESG Datatracker Pages</h2>

     <div class="alert-info">

     </div>

  <h2>Version 2.00: Django Port of the Public Datatracker Pages</h2>

  <p>
     This release was a complete re-write of the CGI/Perl-based IESG datatracker
     in Python, using the Django framework.  It comprised about 8000 lines of
     Python code, and 6000 lines of template code.  The work was done as a
     skunkworks project by Bill Fenner and Henrik Levkowetz from mid-April
     to mid-May 2007, and continued as an official project from then on.  The
     aim was to eliminate numerous SQL injection insecurities in the current
     code, and also provide a better framework on which to build future enhancements.
     During the most intensive period, Bill and Henrik worked 10 hours per day
     to get all public pages ported and released.  The release was deployed
     in the early hours of 28 June 2007, and nobody noticed the change :-))
  </p>

  <h2>Version 1.0: Initial Perl/MySQL database and web-pages</h2>

  <p>
     The first version of the idtracker was commissioned by the IESG under <i>Harald
     Alvestrand</i> in 2001, and the IESG started using it at the beginning of 2002.  It was
     written by <i>Michael Lee</i> in Perl, with direct SQL statements.  It provided a
     major improvement in visibility of the progress of drafts by the IESG.
     The first <a href="https://www.ietf.org/proceedings/55/slides/plenary-6/plenary-6.ppt">
     public presentation</a> of it and its capabilities was made 2002-11-20
     in Atlanta by Thomas Narten.
