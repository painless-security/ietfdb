  <h1>Personal Information in the Datatracker</h1>
   <p>

     <a href="https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3935">RFC 3935, "A Mission Statement for the IETF"</a> lays out
     the goal and the mission of the IETF as follows:
   </p>

   <samp class="preformatted small">   The goal of the IETF is to make the Internet work better.

   The mission of the IETF is to produce high quality, relevant
   technical and engineering documents that influence the way people
   design, use, and manage the Internet in such a way as to make the
   Internet work better.  These documents include protocol standards,
   best current practices, and informational documents of various kinds.

   -->

   <p>

     In order to fulfil its mission, the IETF provides various ways to distribute
     and discuss Internet-Drafts, and otherwise process them until there is
     consensus that they are ready for publication.

   </p>
   <p>

     This makes the information in the content of the draft documents, as well
     as contributions related to the draft documents and their processing as
     laid out in the "<a href="https://www.ietf.org/about/note-well/">Note
     Well</a>" statement, of legitimate interest to the IETF when it pursues
     its mission; not only in general terms, but specifically under Article
     6(1)&nbsp;f) of
     <a href="https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/HTML/?uri=CELEX:32016R0679#d1e1888-1-1">
     EU's General Data Protection Regulation </a>.

   </p>
   <p>

     The datatracker treats all personal information derived from draft documents and
     documents published as RFC, as well as personal information derived from
     processing draft documents through the IETF procedures, in accordance with
     applicable law, including the GDPR.  This includes author names,
     email addresses and other address information provided in draft documents or as
     contact information for IETF roles such as Working Group chairs, secretaries,
     Area Directors and other roles.

   </p>
   <p>

     There is however additional personal information held in the datatracker that
     is used for other purposes. This information requires the consent of the
     individuals whose information is stored and processed which IETF secures
     through various means, and the person it relates to may at any time request
     its correction or removal. This includes:

   </p>

   <ul>
     <li>Personal photograph or other likeness;</li>
     <li>Personal biography;</li>
     <li>Personal email addresses not derived from IETF contributions; and </li>
     <li>Personal account login information</li>
     <li>Personal notification subscriptions</li>
   </ul>

   <p>

     Most of this information can be edited on the individual's
     <a href="/accounts/profile/">Account Info</a> page by the individual
     after logging in to the account.  If the datatracker holds such
     information about a person, and they don't have an account, a request to
     the <a href="mailto:{{settings.SECRETARIAT_ACTION_EMAIL}}">IETF secretariat</a> to change
     or remove the information will be honoured to the extent feasible and
     legally permitted.

   </p>
