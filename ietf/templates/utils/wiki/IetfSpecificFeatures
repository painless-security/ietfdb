== Editing the Wiki and Issues ==

In order to create and edit wiki pages and issues, you need to log in.  Click on the
small 'Login' link above the main horizontal menubar.  You log in with the same
username (your email address) and password as the datatracker.  If you don't have a 
login/passwd or need to reset your passwd, go to https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/create/.

The login and password is also used for commits to the SVN repository.  See more about
the repository further down.

== IETF-Specific Features ==

This Trac installation has a few IETF-specific features which are not generally found
in Trac:

 * Occurences of RFC numbers or draft names in Wiki text will generate links to the
   RFC or draft in question.  Unless you want to point to an RFC or draft in a
   specific location which is different from the automatically generated link, you
   don't need to explicitly add links for RFCs and drafts.  Examples: RFC 2026,
   draft-ietf-poised95-std-proc-3

 * Each issue in the issue tracker can be indicated to concern a 'component'. This is
   a standard Trac feature; however, the list of available components is automatically
   updated to include all the active working group drafts.  This makes it easier to
   associate issues with drafts for the WG participants, without the Chairs needing to
   go in as admin users and add a new component each time there's a new WG draft.

 * Everywhere you can use wiki markup (on the wiki pages, roadmap descriptions,
   etc.) you may embed a macro which shows a ticket statistics graph.  Full
   information about the macro is available at [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TicketStatsMacro].
   Briefly, the macro syntax is:
   {{{
       [[TicketStats( height=250,daterange=12m,res_days=30)]]
   }}}
   which gives this result: [[TicketStats( height=250,daterange=12m,res_days=30)]]
