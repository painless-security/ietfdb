== Editing the Wiki and Issues ==

In order to create and edit wiki pages and issues, you need to log in.  Click on the
small 'Login' link above the main horizontal menubar.  You log in with the same
username (your email address) and password as for all other ''tools.ietf.org'' password
protected accesses.  If you don't have a login/passwd or need to reset your passwd, go
to http://tools.ietf.org/newpasswd .

The login and password is also used for commits to the SVN repository.  See more about
the repository further down.

== IETF-Specific Features ==

This Trac installation has a few IETF-specific features which are not generally found
in Trac:

 * Occurences of RFC numbers or draft names in Wiki text will generate links to the
   RFC or draft in question.  Unless you want to point to an RFC or draft in a
   specific location which is different from the automatically generated link, you
   don't need to explicitly add links for RFCs and drafts.  Examples: RFC 2026,
   draft-ietf-poised95-std-proc-3

 * Each issue in the issue tracker can be indicated to concern a 'component'. This is
   a standard Trac feature; however, the list of available components is automatically
   updated to include all the active working group drafts.  This makes it easier to
   associate issues with drafts for the WG participants, without the Chairs needing to
   go in as admin users and add a new component each time there's a new WG draft.

 * The 'Severity' field of an issue has a special significance if the issue type is
   set to 'state' or 'task'.  In that case, the Severity will be shown as an
   annotation to the draft state on the regular WG status page on tools.ietf.org.
   This can be useful for WG chairs to indicate more exactly the state of a WG draft,
   which will otherwise simply be indicated as 'Active' on the status page, until it
   is sent to the IESG for processing.

 * If issues are registered against a draft ,indicated by setting the issue's
   'component' field to the appropriate (abbreviated) draft name, the status page
   will show a progress bar, indicating the total number of issues for that draft, as
   well as the proportion which have been closed, and the number of still open issues.

 * Everywhere you can use wiki markup (on the wiki pages, roadmap descriptions,
   etc.) you may embed a macro which shows a ticket statistics graph.  Full
   information about the macro is available at [http://trac-hacks.org/wiki/TicketStatsMacro].
   Briefly, the macro syntax is:
   {{{
       [[TicketStats( height=250,daterange=12m,res_days=30)]]
   }}}
   which gives this result: [[TicketStats( height=250,daterange=12m,res_days=30)]]

Issue tracker changes which are reflected in the WG status pages ('Severity'
annotations and issue progress bars) may take up to 1 hour to propagate from the
server which hosts the Trac instance (trac.tools.ietf.org) to the other tools servers.

== Integration with tools.ietf.org ==

For all working groups which have an instance of Trac installed, the URL to Trac for
that WG has the form '''''!http://tools.ietf.org/wg/<wg>/trac'''''.
There's also a link to the Trac issue tracker and a link to the Trac
wiki in the horizontal menu on the WG status page
'''''!http://tools.ietf.org/wg/<wg>'''''
once Trac has been installed.

== SVN Repository ==

For each WG with a Trac instance there is also a SVN repository, with an URL of the
form '''''!https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/<wg>'''''.  Anybody can check out from
the repository, but you need to use the tools server login and password in order to
commit to the repository.

To check out a repository with a command-line svn client, see this example for the ''hybi'' WG:

{{{
work/ $ svn co --username=henrik@levkowetz.com https://svn.tools.ietf.org/svn/wg/hybi/
work/ $ cd hybi/
hybi/ $
}}}

SVN also lets you check out parts of the repository tree, but for more info on
that, please see the documentation on http://subversion.apache.org/.

To add a document to the repository, place the document in your SVN working folder,
tell SVN it should be added, and when ready, commit it to the repository:
{{{
hybi/ $ svn add draft-foo-bar-baz.txt
hybi/ $ #...
hybi/ $ svn commit draft-foo-bar-baz.txt -m "Commit message ..."
hybi/ $
}}}

The IETF Trac instances use a variation of the Trac SVN hook script which is provided
with Trac.  This script updates Track Issue Tickets based on keywords in the SVN
commit messages; the keywords and their use is described in SvnTracHooks.
