Dear {{ person.plain_name }},

We write to address certain personal information stored in your IETF
datatracker profile.  Going forward, we will maintain and use your personal
information only with your consent.

If you do nothing in response to this email, the information in your profile
that requires consent ({{ fields|safe }}) will be deleted {{ days }} days from
the date of this email, that is, on {{ date }}.  If you later wish to create a
new login, you can do so at
{{ settings.IDTRACKER_BASE_URL }}{% url 'ietf.ietfauth.views.create_account' %}.

If you would like us to continue to maintain and process the information that
requires your consent, please go to 
{{ settings.IDTRACKER_BASE_URL }}{% url 'ietf.ietfauth.views.profile' %}, 
and review and edit the information as desired and confirm your consent to our
continued maintenance and use of your information by checking the 'Consent'
checkbox found at the bottom of the page, and then submit the form.

For information on how personal information is handled in the datatracker, please see
{{ settings.IDTRACKER_BASE_URL }}/help/personal-information.

In case you prefer to not follow any email links, due to phishing
considerations, please just go to the datatracker and use the menu
entries to log in or create an account.  The links above are provided
for your convenience, but it works just as well to go the datracker
manually and do what's needed.

Please note that you cannot give consent simply by replying to this email;
you must log in to your account and do so there.


Thank You,
The IETF Secretariat
