This directory contains files for a webfont generated by http://fontello.com
open source project.  It contains 2 glyphs not readily available in the font
libraries used in the datatracker:  A Meetecho glyph and a Groupd glyph that
communicates group conference better.  These are both used in the link lists
on the IETF agenda page.

To add more glyphs, follow the instructions available at
https://github.com/fontello/fontello/wiki/How-to-save-and-load-projects.  The
config.json file in the same directory as this README file contains all the
information needed by fontello to set up things so that you can continue
working, to add new glyphs for instance.
